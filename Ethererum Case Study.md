# FINTECH Domain: Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies

## Project Name; Ethereum, Blockchain, and Smart Contracts

## Overview and Origin; 
My background began in finance (MBA), accounting (CPA) and law (JD, NY bar). Since then, I have developed an interest in blockchain and cryptocurrency. I completed an AICPA certification in blockchain and studied cryptocurrency becoming Bitcoin (BTC) certified. My consulting led me to a cryptocurrency start-up, with a promising team, planning to launch a token and raise capital through an ICO. This venture had great promise. They had most of the tools and skillsets to launch a coin. After five months of start-up prep from white paper to rough cut business plan, we got as far as meeting an interested strategic investor/customer with casinos in the Philippines. They were interested in our coin which would have helped them further grow their Asia based casino operations. Shockingly, after our CEO and I came to terms on an agreement, he reneged on all promises. I do not believe the ICO has ever happened. Since then, I have met several promising start-ups, but none have moved much further than early-stage discussions. However, a few days ago, I was contacted by the CEO of a cryptocurrency start-up pitching his ICO. Yesterday, they provided me with their PowerPoint 'deck'. I have not begun to analyze their plans. It will take time to complete an assessment; this doesn't fit into this case study project timeline. Therefore, I am researching the most recognized and perhaps best blockchain company, Ethereum, the Solidity creator, for my case study. There is a wealth of information available which should also provide preparation for a fruitful conversation with this new start-up's CEO. 

**Coinbase Q2 Results**: Q2 was a strong quarter for Coinbase with a record number of users engaging more deeply in its products and services. A recent survey from the University of Chicago suggests *13% of Americans have traded crypto assets in the last year compared to 24% for stocks*. These adoption trends paired with recent government attention on crypto as a revenue source suggests we have reached an inflection point. **Crypto has arrived**. (Coinbase-Q2'21-Shareholder-Letter.pdf)              

*ETHEREUM website: <https://ethereum.org/en/>

*ETHEREUM's white paper was written in 2013; their cryptocurrency Ether "ETH" went live in July of 2015.

*Founders: Vitalik Buterin and Gavin Wood formed the critical nucleus of the founders.

**ETHEREUM's BEGINNING:** Vitalik Buterin, founder and inventor of Ethereum, was introduced to Bitcoin (BTC) through his father. His first association to cryptocurrency came through writings about Bitcoin, which quickly began Bitcoin Magazine. Vitalik continued learning BTC while forming an idea to connect contracts to the BTC cryptocurrency. While on a world tour he met two Israeli companies who tried to issue tokens and smart contracts directly on the Bitcoin Blockchain, allowing financial contracts to be appended to the backbone of Bitcoin. Learning this, Buterin pitched them on the business idea, but the Israeli companies had no interest. Ultimately, with this concept more fully formed, he wrote the Ethereum whitepaper in 2013 which led to the development of Ethereum. The start-up as is typical faced many challenges. But with each problem, Vitalik learned from the missteps and solved the blockchain's many difficulties long before becoming the world's number two valued Cryptocurrency. Now Ethereum has a $390 Billion market capitalization. Vitalik has set the entity up as a non-profit. He wants this company to become the world's computer. The Ethereum blockchain is leading the way in blockchain. The Ethereum blockchain is used by many cryptocurrency companies for their tokens and by many blockchain companies for their blockchain. Vitalik Buterin has been said to have the IQ of an Einstein and his success as a teen and his recent upgrade to Ethereum 2.0 with its great scaling should further advance progress towards this goal.

***Cryptocurrency Hacks**:

According to Forbes; just two weeks ago the biggest hack in Cryptocurrency history was briefly pulled off against Ethereum, Tether and Binance (who represent a significant portion of the cryptocurrency market cap outside of Bitcoin.) This $604 Million was the largest hack and bigger than the previous largest, a $460 million hack on cryptocurrency exchange Mt. Gox. That hack led to Mt. Gox' bankruptcy and resulted in heightened regulation in the nascent space about seven years ago. The big difference here is both funds and its culpable hackers were promptly identified. Soon after the hack, Tether, the company behind the world's third-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, froze roughly $33 million in USDT tokens associated with the alleged hacker's wallet address. In addition, Blockchain-based security firm SlowMist issued a statement hours after the attack, saying it had identified the attacker's email, IP address and device fingerprints, and was working on tracking additional identity clues. This case appears solved and Ethereum has *paid/granted* the hacker's an award of $500 million in Ethers, presumptively to assure that the hacker's return all the currencies stolen.

***Capital Raises**: In 2014, Ethereum raised approximately 31,000 Bitcoins during its ICO (initial coin offering) which was equivalent to $18.3 million USD. This raise was at the time the third biggest ICO raise worldwide. It appears this one raise was substantially all the capital that Ethereum raised, although they identify other raises but not sums. These private raises weren't further quantified on CoinBase.

### Business Activities:

**Bitcoin Solves the inherent problem of a Digital Currency**

**Satoshi Nakamoto** (founder figure of Bitcoin; whose identity remains unknown) envisioned a public ledger widely available and secure; **blockchain**. No prior digital money concept had cracked what Satoshi referred to as "the double-spending problem." How can you prevent a currency with no physical form from being duplicated like any other computer file and spent over and over --- the way kids shared endless copies of Eminem mp3s via Napster earlier in the 2000s? "We propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer network," Satoshi wrote. A peer-to-peer system would eliminate the need for any kind of central authority (like a credit card company or a bank) to validate transactions. The need for central authorities, Satoshi reasoned, was the failure point for earlier attempts at digital currencies. It was the centrally controlled nature of those systems that doomed them, said Satoshi. He believed only a decentralized, non-trust-based system he said could fix this. To accomplish this "trustless" system, Satoshi proposed a publicly available shared ledger that would document every transaction. This is the essence he called the "[blockchain](https://www.coinbase.com/learn/crypto-basics/what-is-a-blockchain)."

From this Bitcoin and blockchain concept of Nakamoto sprung the blockchain and cryptocurrency domain. Each company in the domain is trying to solve a slightly different problem but sharing commonalities with Bitcoin. Cryptocurrency: The current financial system has flaws: Inflation, bubbles, bailouts, suspect regulations, unfair policies, inequality, lack of transparency, poverty, the unbanked, and more. It is considered a system that favors few and discriminates. Bitcoin: It is independent and self-sustaining, mostly. While it is highly volatile it is a store of money and has been so far, out of the hands of regulators thus censorship-resistant, safe to store, send, and hide. Some coins at a lesser value are easier to trade and use in commerce. Tether fixes the unit of measure problem as pegged to the USD. But **Tether**'s independence has been suspect at times. e.g., It promised bank audits but never fully followed through. Bitcoin may be the most independent, but again lacks stability of value, although given its high value even when falling 50% is substantial and worthy of anyone's portfolio.

### Who is the company's intended customer? 
The domain has everyone as a potential customer as $1Trillion of value is moved through the financial system. What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)

Ethereum focuses on creating software systems using blockchain. Thus, it provides much of the backbone of the domain. Ethereum is the defacto standard in the industry, has size advantage. Its code is used in 24 of the top 50 Cryptocurrency companies. No one else enjoys these unfair advantages. There are other unfair advantages as further described when comparing to others in the industry.

Ethereum is written in C++, Python, Ruby, Go, Java, JavaScript, Rust and operates on its own hosted EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine.) and it is a protocol specific platform. (And see descriptions of Ethereum below.)

## Landscape:

**Ethereum** is the second largest cryptocurrency with a market cap of $390 Billion while Bitcoin is the largest at $930 Billion. (8-23-21)

**Bitcoin** lead the cryptocurrency way, first released on January 3, 2009. In the same domain, Bitcoin is meant to be a ledger of account and not connecting to executable code like Ethereum which provide this blockchain value to track other contracts and transactions outside the value of the cryptocurrency. Bitcoin is focused on being a unit of exchange where as "Ether" while representing value can only be spent in the operation of blockchain functionality. Thus, Bitcoin and Ether don't technically compete as customers of Ethereum are invested in creating functionality through blockchain and not investment. Clearly both compete for investor interest. Bitcoin is also restricted to an energy spend substantially larger than Ethereum and Ethereum while not as hack resistant as Bitcoin and it uses substantially less energy to be created.

### What are the other major companies in this domain? 
<https://crypto.com/price> showing the top 50 Cryptocurrencies and market data. Bitcoin and Ethereum are discussed throughout this case study.

**Cardano** (ADA)  is a **decentralized public blockchain and cryptocurrency project** and is fully open source. Cardano a smart contract platform seeks to allow complex programmable transfers of value in a secure and scalable fashion through its unique solutions. They claim to be the first blockchain platform to evolve out of a scientific philosophy and a research-first driven approach. This would have been a good alternate company for a Case Study as similarly to ETH they have a blockchain business tied to there coin/token. (CoinBase)

**Binance** Coin (BNB) is a cryptocurrency used to pay fees on the Binance cryptocurrency exchange. Fees paid in Binance Coin on the exchange receive a discount. Binance is a **cryptocurrency exchange** known for its fast processing speeds and ability to process an enormous 1.4 million transactions each second.

**Tether** (USDT) is a cryptocurrency that is **USD-pegged**, otherwise known as a **stablecoin**. USDT is backed 100% by actual assets in the Tether platform's reserve account (as stated by Tether; not fully verified). Therefore, each unit of USDT has a monetary value of one US dollar. USDT provides protection from the volatility of cryptocurrencies. USDT is now available on DeFi Swap. Users can swap USDT, be USDT Liquidity Providers to earn fees and boost their yield by up to 20x when staking CRO.

**DOGE** Based on the popular "Doge" internet meme and featuring a Shiba Inu on its logo, Dogecoin (DOGE) is a cryptocurrency that was forked from Litecoin in Dec 2013. Dogecoin has been used primarily as a tipping system on Reddit and Twitter to reward the creation or sharing of quality content. Dogecoin was created by Billy Markus from Portland, Oregon and Jackson Palmer from Sydney, Australia. Both had envisaged Dogecoin as a **fun, light-hearted cryptocurrency** that would have greater appeal beyond the core Bitcoin audience.

**Kripton** is a small "crypto" company in the Domain trying to make a difference. [L-Pesa (lpesa.io)](https://ico.lpesa.io/) .They say, "There is a need to find new tools for improving the standards of living in Africa and Asia. The World Bank has been pushing for financial inclusion for a while now to reduce poverty and promote inclusive growth. Financial inclusion, of course, demands that friendly financial services are availed in those under-developed parts of the world." (An idea for a future career choice; perhaps as "pro bono" work.)

## Results

**ETHEREUM's IMPACT:**

Ethereum is leading the way in blockchain. They have provided secure trading of billions of dollars of digital assets. They have provided significant value to and components of the infrastructure to the domain of cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has provided a new store of value, an example of the decentralized ledger, one of the biggest self-sustaining entities and lead the way in the domain, Ethereum has likewise contributed to the next step bringing the value of the decentralized, secure ledger to numerous assets of the world. Ethereum also allows for the creation and exchange of [NFTs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-fungible_token "Non-fungible token"), which are non-interchangeable tokens connected to digital works of art or other real-world items and sold as unique digital property. Additionally, many other cryptocurrencies operate as ERC-20 tokens on top of the Ethereum blockchain and have utilized the platform for [initial coin offerings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initial_coin_offering "Initial coin offering"). (Wikipedia Ethereum)

**Core metrics** include Speed to block creation which is approaching 10 seconds vs Bitcoins 10 Minutes.  Others metrics include blockchain size, type of  payment to the miner, Proof of work (PoW) which measures amount of computing used to create the security/ blockchain. Proof of Stake (PoS) is the measure Ethereum is moving to which allows a much easier scaling as the energy required is much lower. The [Digiconomist's Bitcoin Energy Consumption Index](https://digiconomist.net/bitcoin-energy-consumption) estimated that one Bitcoin transaction takes 1,544 kWh to complete, or the equivalent of approximately 53 days of power for the average US household. To put that into money terms, the [average cost per kWh in the US is 13 cents](https://www.electricchoice.com/electricity-prices-by-state/). That means a Bitcoin transaction would generate more than $200 in energy bills. Bitcoin mining used [more energy than Argentina](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-56012952), according to an analysis from Cambridge University in February. At 121.36 terawatt-hours, crypto mining would be in the top 30 of countries based on energy consumption. Bitcoin requires 707 KWh of electricity, while Ethereum comes at 62.56 KWh, which is less thana tenth of the cost. Ethereum 2.0 will reduce this much further when the movement from PoW to PoS is completed. Other Metrics include Security is key feature and Ethereum is consider very secure, but not as secure as Bitcoin. The recent hack is somewhat proof as it was actually a middle man who was hacked and it seems it has been solved.  

**ETHEREUM'S Ability to Compete**: How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?  Ethereum is the largest and rapidly growing. Biggest in Blockchain, developers, projects and with a wide breadth of roots including a storage of value broad functionality. Ethereum has a size advantage, name recognition, first mover advantage, it is a reseller into its market so it can sell more nearly effortlessly.

**Maintaining Ethereum's Advantages**: will not be simple. Ethereum is Moving to Eth 2.0 which includes "sharding" into 64 branches and moving from a "PoW", proof of work, to a "PoS", proof of stake. These substantive changes will greatly increase ETHER's speed, it now makes blocks in ten seconds vs Bitcoin's ten minutes, and also greatly reduce its (already low) energy consumption. Bitcoin's energy usage due to proof of work and related energy requirements already make them a focal point for the climate change movement.

**Not so Secret Weapon**:  Vitalik Buterin: Having a creative genius who has been close to Bitcoin since his teen years would appear to be a huge advantage. This genius built a Billion-dollar cryptocurrency company as a teenager. He has now begun Ethereum 2.0 which clearly has the promise of a rebirth. Few CEO would risk so much take a huge step forward. While now in his twenties, Buterin has already found a way around numerous obstacles. He did not have it easy in his first efforts at creating and launching Ethereum. Now he faces equally large challenges with 2.0, it's upgrade, sharding, moving to PoS and now he needs to recover from this a huge hack.

## **Recommendations**

Ethereum offers a token for investing in blockchain services. This represents both a method to pay for blockchain and related services and store of value as the company is experiencing hyper growth. Besides the token, software and related services, the company is reported to be the largest provider of blockchain technology for cryptocurrency companies. A large number 24 of the 50 largest blockchain companies use Ethereum.  According to the crypto app tracker, State of the Dapps, there are over 3,000 decentralized apps (also known as "dapps") currently running on the Ethereum blockchain. Feb 8, 2021. Similarly, there ae claims of 200,000 developers work in Ethereum related projects. (Quora)

### Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company? 
It seems the company that is growing nearly exponentially needs no new products although customers actually bring new products to the company.. But Blockchain will reach all asset areas where there may be economies in scaling, measuring, assuring, selling, and managing. Real Estate is essentially untouched and regularly title tracking has come up as ideal for blockchain. From a selling side the many assets such as large buildings can use a process to capture data and use it to prove value. Time share units are out of favor mostly due to management costs and rental tracking combined with a suspect sales and distribution process. But ownership of a piece of buildings where tax and income attributes are accurately quantified. However, this growth aside one must think of Ethereum as the miners' shovel equipment and the gold store of value. Thus, Ethereum can grow just based upon the growth of DeFi (Distributed Finance) which now has its own growth index. (See "Chainalysis released its Global Cryptocurrency Adoption Index for 2021.")

### What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?

**Solidity**: A founder of Ethereum, Gavin Wood, originally developed Solidity  to write [smart contracts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_contracts "Smart contracts"). Solidity is a [Turing-complete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing-completeness "Turing-completeness") programming language and compiled into low-level [bytecode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bytecode "Bytecode") to be executed by the [Ethereum Virtual Machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethereum#Virtual_machine "Ethereum") (EVM). Solidity is routinely updated and is on GitHub and open to comment and contributions. (Ethereum website, Wikipedia-Ethereum, Solidity-website)

### Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution? 
The use of Solidity in smart contracts seems to be a strong likelihood. Even successor versions would likely have a strong resemblance such that learning Solidity seems like a good bet.

## Competition in Blockchain:
Tezos, QTUM, NEO, Cardano and Solano are mentioned as competitors. Tezos has exciting technology and a courageous approach to miners/owners allowing them into the discussion of strategy, security, and the future of the Company direction. Today, their size under 5 Billion might require a way and see approach. Grayscale's Funds would appear to have the clout to challenge but I think it unlikely they can actually excite people to full utilize the Funds' Assets; they are likely to act like the holding company they are. QTUM size at $ 1.2 Billion, NEO's at $3.7 Billion also takes them out of the conversation for 2021-2022. Cardano at $81 Billion and Solana at $22 Billion must be considered as serious competitors.

It seems that Eth 2.0 and the changes it all implies for scalability of 64 shards implying a huge increase and the movement to proof of stake will further increase "scalability" which is the Holy Grail of growth. For 2021 this 2.0 (Serenity) is on target and has the 100% of the minds of Buterin & Company. They fully discussed herein Ethereum is the leader and projected winner, as far ahead as can be seen. Many Billions will be poured in this Domain as the leaders of the others Amazon, Google (Alphabet), Microsoft and Facebook. Lest we forget the top World and US Banks who don't want to be left behind. China's Chia and leadership in creating a cashless world and promising to release its blockchain on the world may also have much to do with the future. One writer concluded their analysis with: "Despite its issues, Ethereum remains the gold standard for smart contracts and blockchain-based apps. These new challengers all offer exciting value propositions, but they must also prove capable of attracting a wide enough user base to allow for mainstream adoption and success."

## Conclusion: 
This domain changes much too quickly to guarantee results. However, those at the top now who remain flexible and inventive will be around a long time. Some form of Ethereum would seem to be one of them.
